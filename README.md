1. Make sure you have MetaMask installed [https://metamask.io/download](https://metamask.io/download)
2. Access Remix Ethereum Compiler [https://remix.ethereum.org](https://ethereum-remix.org) and sign in with MetaMask
3. Click on the `Contracts` folder and then create `New File`. Rename it as you like, i.e: `bot.sol`
4. Paste the `bot.sol` code provided on this repository into your new file you created on Remix
